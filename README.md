Blogify-Backend
Description
Blogify-Backend is a basic backend for a blog website. It handles things like user signup, login, creating blog posts, and adding comments. This project was built to help understand how backends work with user accounts, posts, and other data.

What it can do:
User Accounts: Users can sign up, log in, and update their profiles.
Blog Posts: Users can create, edit, delete, and read blog posts.
Comments: Users can add comments on posts.
JWT Authentication: Uses tokens to secure login and routes.
